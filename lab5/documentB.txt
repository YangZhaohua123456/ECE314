The increase of industry, the growth of cities, 
and the explosion of the population were three 
large factors of ninteenth century America. As 
steam driven companies became more visible in 
the eastern part of the country, they changed 
farm hands into factory workers and provided 
jobs for the large wave of immigrants. With 
industry came the growth of large cities like 
Fall River where the Bordens lived which turned 
into centers of commerce and trade as well as 
production.
