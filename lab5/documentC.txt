Fall River, where the Borden family lived, 
was typical of northeastern industrial 
cities of the nineteenth century. Steam-
powered production had shifted labor from 
agriculture to manufacturing, and as 
immigrants arrived in the US, they found work 
in these new factories. As a result, 
populations grew, and large urban areas arose. 
Fall River was one of these manufacturing and 
commercial centers.
